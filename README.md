# gitea-hash-organizer
A simple python script to organize Gitea hashes.

## This was a script I made for organizing hashes incase I run into Gitea while playing CTFs. 

### Usage:

``python3 script.py -i <ITERATIONS> -s <SALT> -H <HASH>``

## This will output hashes in both John the ripper and Hashcat format
