# gitea-hash-organizer

## This was a script I made for organizing hashes incase I run into Gitea while playing CTFs. 

### Usage:

``python3 script.py -i <ITERATIONS> -s <SALT> -H <HASH>``

## This will output hashes in both John the ripper and Hashcat format

### âš  You should only use this against hashes in a controlled environment, such as hacking labs from TryHackMe or Hack The Box or from other challenges. You should never attempt to gain unauthorized access to someone else's hashes and/or passwords.
